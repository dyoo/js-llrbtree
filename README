Functional left-leaning red black trees

A JavaScript implementation ported from:
http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/red-black-tree/



----------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm just taking the code from Kazu Yamamoto's implementation:

    https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/llrbtree

and porting what I need from it to JavaScript.  I don't think I need
the height or removeMax/removeMin implementations, so I haven't yet
ported that code over.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Binds LLRBTree as a namespace with the following names:


EMPTY : llrbtree

    The empty tree.



insert : llrbtree X (X X -> Integer) -> llrbtree

    Insert an element into the llrbtree, according to the provided comparator.



remove: llrbtree X (X X -> Integer) -> llrbtree

    Remove an element from the llrbtree, according to the provided comparator.



The operations are functional, and should allow me to build a nice
functional map abstraction out of the pieces.
